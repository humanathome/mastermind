## The Odin Project: Mastermind
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns 
(like hangman with colored pegs).

### Assignment
- Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you 
guessing the computer’s random code
- Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors and the human player must guess them
- Refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or 
the guesser.
